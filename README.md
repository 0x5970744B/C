Synopsis
==============
This is my personal repo of small code snippets that I plan to make use of eventually as many snippets I find online are messy, poorly documented, or contain way more code than necessary.


Motivation
==============
I decided to learn a little C since I know I'll need it eventually. I started programming these immediately after writing up my first C hello world in 2018 =)


Long Term Coding Research/Exploration Interests
==============
In order of interest level, though not in order of when I'll attempt to do these:
1) Memory parsing - my guess is the industry is still doing very badly at this, and this will still be relevant in 2-5+ years time. Won't elaborate.
2) Various methods of performing Windows hooking
3) Self defence mechanisms - protection of the current/other process memory space, protection of disk files and folders
4) Various methods of bypassing the Windows API to do the same thing a particular API does, per kernel version if necessary and with fallback to the official API
5) File parsing to retrieve static information about a file
6) Undocumented Windows APIs, starting with Windows 10
7) Remote debugging


If you have similar interests and have the technical ability to back this up, contact me if you are interested in a long term collaboration. You should be able to guess my skill level and the direction I'm heading toward with this slow-paced research.
