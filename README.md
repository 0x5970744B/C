Synopsis
==============
This is my personal repo of small code snippets that I plan to make use of eventually as many snippets I find online are messy, poorly documented, or contain way more code than necessary.


Motivation
==============
I decided to learn a little C since I know I'll need it eventually. I started programming these immediately after writing up my first C hello world in 2018 =)
