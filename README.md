Synopsis
==============
Currently this project only hosts C code in the "Snippets" directory because none of them are useful enough to be a full fledged programs yet.

I am writing C code here and there as practice, and hopefully eventually this repository might become useful because a lot of code snippets I find online are messy, poorly documented, or contain way more code than necessary.
A lot of them also use C++ when they don't have to. I'll get to C++ when it is required, but not before then.


Motivation
==============
I know a whole ton of computer related languages and can dive into nearly any of them pretty easily, with the exceptions of C and C++ because of memory management (strangely I feel more confident of learning ASM than C).

So I decided to learn a little C since I know I'll need it eventually. I started programming these immediately after writing up my first C hello world =)
